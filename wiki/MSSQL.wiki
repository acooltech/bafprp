#summary Details for output form 'Microsoft SQL Server'

= Microsoft SQL Server =

Will send data to a sql server specified by the user.  


== Properties ==

  * database - the destination database
  * server - the server
  * user - user name with INSERT and SELECT privileges
  * password - password for user
  * table - table for inserting records

*NOTE* Only 1 database, server, user, and password will be used for all 3 types of output.  If you specify different values, the first one used will be used throughout the duration of the program.

== Tables ==

=== Log Table ===

{{{
create table logs
(
id bigint IDENTITY(1,1),
ts datetime,
loglevel smallint,
msg text
)
}}}

It is recommended to make id the primary key and create an index for loglevel

=== Error Table ===

{{{
create table errors
(
id bigint IDENTITY(1,1),
ts datetime not null,
error text not null,
filename varchar(255),
filepos int,
type varchar(255),
length int,
bytes text
)
}}}

It is recommended to make id the primary key

=== Records ===

The record table operates a little differently.  It has no specific structure like log or error, instead when it comes time to insert a record bafprp will first query the Information Schema for a list of the column names.  It will then match those column names to elements that are in the current record.

For example, if we wanted to record the calling number, the called number, and the elapsed time we would make a table like this

{{{
create table records
(
id bigint IDENTITY(1,1),
callingnumber varchar(25) not null,
callednumber varchar(25) not null,
duration bigint not null
)
}}}

The function will automatically match those columns and insert the data accordingly.  There are a couple of things to note while using this behavior.  Firstly, if a record has no data in common with the sql table, it will not be recorded.  Secondly, if there is a n error inserting the record an error message will be created through the error output type.  These should be checked often.  

For a complete list of the different field types in a record, please download the source, a wiki page will be up later.

In addition to these field types there are also special fields recognized by the output function.  
  * type - the type of record
  * size - the size of the record
  * crc - the crc32 hash 
  * filename - the filename of the baf file
  * filepos - the position of this record in the baf file

You may add these columns to your records table for extra data.
