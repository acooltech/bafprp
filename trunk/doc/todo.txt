1. Make generic type classes for fields 
			There are to many different types of header files that do exactly the same thing
			Make a system where we keep 4 or 5 generic field types like 'date', 'time', 'integer', etc
			And allow individual fields to customize it for their information, name, type, string display, etc.
			
2. Once this is done, fix getField to reference the field type name, not the type description.
			Who the hell thought of referencing the type description anyway, geese
			
3. Might be interesting to allow multiple types of output for one log, record, or error message

Things to finish before v1.0

	- Add mssql output type
	- fix static getFilename in BafFile, that was a stupid idea
	- Finish file output
	- Change getType attribute of fields to return the type name, not the desired type, eugggg
