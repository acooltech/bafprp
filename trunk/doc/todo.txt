1. Make generic type classes for fields 
			There are to many different types of header files that do exactly the same thing
			Make a system where we keep 4 or 5 generic field types like 'date', 'time', 'integer', etc
			And allow individual fields to customize it for their information, name, type, string display, etc.
			
2. Once this is done, fix getField to reference the field type name, not the type description.
			Who the hell thought of referencing the type description anyway, geese
