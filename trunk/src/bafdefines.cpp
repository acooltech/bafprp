	This is the most confusing function in this entire program.
	Heres the basic idea, our baf file has a string os text packed in nibbles (4 bits)
	Usually a character such as 9 is stored as 0x39 (ascii code) in a file, but it is different
	here.
	Since this document contains no real 'strings' they opted to store numbers as 4 bits instead of 8.
	Meaning their alphabet only consists of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
	Example:
		Regular storage of "92"
			- 3932
		Baf file storage of "92"
			- 092C
	To decode a number we must read each nibble one by one.
	This function steps over each nibble and appends the character to a string which we then return.
